"""üõë Workflow Run Cancellation - Stopping Multi-Step Processes

This example shows how to cancel workflow runs during execution.
Workflows often involve multiple steps that can be cancelled between stages.
Perfect for scenarios like:
- Long data processing pipelines
- Multi-step analysis workflows  
- Complex automation sequences

Run `pip install openai agno` to install dependencies.
