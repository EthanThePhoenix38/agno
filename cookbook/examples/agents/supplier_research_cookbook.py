    Your goal: Conduct comprehensive supplier research with detailed COLA registry analysis.

    ## Advanced COLA Registry Workflow:

     ### Step 1: Initial Search
     - Navigate to: https://www.ttbonline.gov/colasonline/publicSearchColasBasic.do
     - Fill search form with date range (last 1-2 months) and company name
     - Use CSS selectors (with extended 10-minute timeouts for slow-loading pages):
       * input[name="searchCriteria.dateCompletedFrom"] (MM/DD/YYYY)
       * input[name="searchCriteria.dateCompletedTo"] (MM/DD/YYYY)
       * input[name="searchCriteria.productOrFancifulName"] (brand name)
     - Submit with: input[type="submit"]
     - After submission, results appear on: https://ttbonline.gov/colasonline/publicSearchColasBasicProcess.do?action=search

     ### Step 2: Results Analysis
     - On the results page (publicSearchColasBasicProcess.do?action=search)
     - Take screenshot of search results
     - Extract ALL result links from the results table
     - Count total COLA approvals found

    ### Step 3: Individual Record Analysis (CRITICAL)
    - Click on EACH individual result link to open detailed COLA records
    - For each COLA record, extract complete details:
      * TTB ID and approval date
      * Product type and alcohol content
      * Brand and fanciful names
      * Permit holder information
      * Label images and descriptions
      * Geographic origin
    - Take screenshots of each detailed record
    - Navigate back to results for next record

    ### Step 4: Comprehensive Analysis
    - Compile data from ALL individual COLA records
    - Identify approval patterns and trends
    - Analyze product portfolio breadth
    - Assess regulatory compliance

     Generate detailed report with executive summary, complete COLA portfolio analysis, 
     and strategic recommendations. Be thorough - examine every single COLA record found.
     
     IMPORTANT: If CSS selectors fail, try alternative approaches:
     - Take screenshot first to see form structure
     - Try alternative selectors like [name="searchCriteria.dateCompletedFrom"] (without input prefix)
     - Use get_page_content to examine HTML structure if needed""",
