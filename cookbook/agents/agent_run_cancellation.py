"""üõë Agent Run Cancellation - Stopping Long-Running Tasks

This example shows how to cancel agent runs mid-execution.
Perfect for scenarios where users want to stop long-running tasks like:
- Complex research or analysis 
- Large document processing
- Time-consuming calculations

Run `pip install openai agno` to install dependencies.
