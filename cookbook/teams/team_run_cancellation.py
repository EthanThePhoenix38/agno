"""üõë Team Run Cancellation - Stopping Collaborative Tasks

This example shows how to cancel team runs while agents are collaborating.
Useful for scenarios like:
- Long research projects with multiple agents
- Complex analysis requiring team coordination
- Multi-agent workflows that need to be stopped

Run `pip install openai agno` to install dependencies.
